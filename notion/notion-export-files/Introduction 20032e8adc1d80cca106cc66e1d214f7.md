## Course Best Practices

To get the most out of this course, keep these tips in mind:

- **Video Playback:** You can adjust video speed up to 2x or slow it down to suit your learning pace. If videos appear blurry, check the gear icon for quality settings; all videos are uploaded in 1080p.
- **Navigation:** Use the **curriculum tab** to easily move between lectures.
- **Platform Issues:** For problems with the Udemy platform (e.g., buffering), contact **support@udemy.com** or submit a request via the Udemy support page. The instructor is not responsible for platform functionality.
- **Reference Materials:** Always **watch the videos and reference the provided notebooks**. The code for deep learning can be complex, so ensure your code matches the notebooks exactly.
- **Course Environment:** Always use the **course environment file** with the provided notebooks. It's highly recommended to run the notebook files directly rather than copying and pasting code to avoid typos and ensure compatibility.

## Where to Find Course Materials

- **Notebooks and Data Files:** All notebooks and data files are available as a **large ZIP file** via a resource link in this lecture and the very next lecture. It's the same file, so download from either.
- **Slides:** The Google Slides used throughout the course are linked in the **first lecture of their respective sections**. For example, to find slides for the Convolutional Neural Networks section, go to the first lecture of that section.

## How to Ask Questions and Get Help

Follow these steps to quickly find answers to your questions:

1. **Verify Your Setup:** Ensure you've run the provided notebook file within the designated environment file (discussed in the installation lecture). All notebook code is checked against this environment, so syntax errors are likely due to typos, incorrect copying/pasting, or not using the provided environment.
2. **Check Videos:** The instructor often preemptively answers questions in the videos. If you have a question about a specific notebook section, check the corresponding video.
3. **Google/Stack Overflow:** For errors or general questions, perform a quick **Google search** or search **Stack Overflow**. These are excellent resources for quickly finding solutions to common issues.
4. **FAQ Lecture:** Search the **Frequently Asked Questions lecture** (the very next lecture) for general course-related or installation questions.
5. **Previous Q&A Posts:** Before posting, search the **course Q&A forums** to see if your question has already been answered by other students or the instructor.
6. **Post to Q&A Forums (if all else fails):** If you still can't find an answer, post your question to the Q&A forums. When posting, be sure to:
    - Clearly state your main error or point of confusion.
    - Link to any resources or Stack Overflow posts you've already reviewed.
    - Include a **video timestamp** (e.g., "minute 12 of lecture 45") if your question relates to a specific part of a lecture.
    - Include a **screenshot** if your error is visual or hard to describe.
    - For installation issues, include details about your **operating system** and the procedure you followed.

## Course Curriculum

The course curriculum is structured as follows:

1. **Installation and Setup:** This section will cover installing and setting up Python and TensorFlow.
2. **Machine Learning Overview:** A quick refresher on machine learning concepts.
3. **Crash Course:** This optional section covers **NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn**. If you're already familiar with these libraries (e.g., from a previous course), you can skip this section or review the exercises and solutions to check your understanding.
4. **Introduction to Neural Networks:** This section provides a slow and general introduction to neural networks, building a manual neural network framework in Python that mimics TensorFlow before you actually use TensorFlow.
5. **TensorFlow Sections:** These sections dive into specific network topics (e.g., recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, autoencoders). Each section typically includes:
    - A theory lecture.
    - An implementation example in TensorFlow.
    - An exercise in TensorFlow.

The instructor expresses gratitude to all students for enrolling and looks forward to teaching you.
